Major features Adds a Pressure Control Ventilator (PCV) mode that oscillates between high and low pressure at a configurable breathing rate (stock firmware supports only a single pressure, with no breath rate control). Allows maximum pressure to be increased to 30 cm H 2 O, as required by clinical protocols (stock firmware is limited to 20cm H 2 O). Allows smooth rapid pressure change rates for respiration rates up to 30 breaths per minute (stock firmware changes pressure at less than 1 cm/sec). Unlocks all of the vendor modes and tunable configuration parameters, including ST and iVAPS modes present in the firmware. Provides access to all of the sensors (flow, pressure, temperature, tidal volume, minute ventilation, etc). Displays real-time graphs on the screen to show an immediate history of sensor data. Development features Visual and audible alarms when flow stoppage or leakage rates are detected. Closed loop air volume control with backup respiration rates and supplemental O 2 . GPIO interface with other systems. Display statistics in conformance with Rapidly Manufactured Ventilator Standards . FAQ What's the difference between CPAP and BiPAP machines? The Airsense 10 that we have modified is a low cost sleep therapy device that provides a Constant Positive Air Pressure to help with sleep apnea and other disorders. This CPAP mode applies constant pressure to the lungs, but it does not ventilate, or let air move in and out of the lungs. The BiPAP machines are more capable devices to treat sleep apnea and COPD that provide Bi-level Positive Airway Pressure. Bi-level pressure triggers on patient breaths, applying higher pressure when the patient tries to breathe in, and a lower pressure when the patient tries to exhale. This is what's called a support mode, which provides additional pressure support to a patient's natural breathing. These differences apply to the devices as they function out of the box . Our work indicates that the actual difference between a low-end CPAP device and a high-end iVAPS device is just a software upgrade . The CPAP machines have many of the same sensors as the more expensive models, and the Airsense 10 CPAP devices include in their firmware all of the other modes, such as iVAPS and BiPAP-ST. When we unlock that mode in software, the CPAP device functions like a much more capable and expensive iVAPS device. This idea, that the difference between CPAP and BiPAP machines is a software change rather than a hardware change, is at the root of our work. If the common, highly distributed CPAP devices could have a software upgrade that turns them into iVAPS or BiPAP-ST devices capable of ventilating COVID patients, that would be a huge boon to the hospitals and health care workers around the world who are struggling with a lack of ventilators or alternatives to treat the influx of COVID patients. Adding a homebrew function to the existing firmware that alternates between pressures with a configurable delay allows the CPAP to effectively function as a Pressure Control Ventilator (PCV) for sedated patients. Enabling the vendor-provided iVAPS mode, along with further customization and new extensions , should make the devices even more flexible and suitable for clinical use. Can jailbroken CPAP devices be used to treat COVID patients? We want to be very clear here: this modified firmware should not be flashed on CPAP machines and used to treat COVID patients immediately. The firmware that we've developed is an effective demonstration of the capability, and while it has been reviewed and validated by expert researchers, biomedical engineers, and clinical pulmonologists , it has not yet been put through FDA approval. Additionally, the Mt Sinai's protocols for off-label non-invasive ventilation require additional modifications such as viral filter and remote control before the machines would be ready for clinical use. Could hacked machines alleviate the shortage of ventilators? If the manufacturers developed their own firmware updates, or the FDA approves our jailbroken firmware, this could have an extremely large role in bridging the ventilator shortage gap. There are millions of unused or underutilized CPAP and BiPAP devices sitting in closets in America, and roughly another 500,000 units in warehouses in the country. These devices can be used as an alternate ventilator, for low-resource hospitals who are still waiting for the hospital ventilators to arrive. Could homebrew firmware go through FDA approval? If there were no other option, our firmware could go through FDA approval, but we believe that the best route for rolling out these upgrades is to work with the manufacturers to use their resources to validate and distribute these upgrades safely and at scale. There are three main factors at play here: The first is a regulatory/safety one: Under the recently-released FDA guidance on hardware and software modification of CPAP and BiPAP devices to treat COVID patients, the manufacturer has carte blanche to release an updated version of their firmware for their own devices without requiring explicit FDA approval -- they are in the best position from a technical, expertise, safety and regulatory perspective. The second is a practical one: There are many different models of CPAP and BiPAP devices, and reverse-engineering is a slow and painful process. We modified the firmware on the most common model of CPAP in America in about a week, but to get lots of ventilators quickly, you'd need a firmware modification for every mode of CPAP. What we've found in our work is that the work needed for the manufacturer to implement these upgrades is pretty minimal -- the manufacturer has access to the source code, to the schematics, and to the engineers who are intimately familiar with physiology and safety standards. We've found that, in many cases, the bulk of the work has already gone through FDA approval, like the iVAPS menu that is in the firmware on the ResMed Airsense device shown above. Even if other manufacturers had not written a line of code for their CPAP models, the pressure-control ventilator mode that we were able to implement is very simple to develop, designed to work on every CPAP device in existence, and would be a very low technology and regulatory barrier for manufacturers with the right people and resources. The third is related to making these jailbreaks at scale: We could take in every unused CPAP device in the country, unscrew the case and re-flash the firmware . It's slow and expensive but could be solved with lots and lots of people. The thing is, of the 8 million CPAPs in the country, almost all 5 million shipped over the last 3 years have an always-on cellular IoT connection, reporting back usage information to doctors and insurance companies. That cellular connection also has over-the-air upgrade capability that can only be accessed from within the IT infrastructure of the device manufacturers. This is a big deal -- it means that they can selectively upgrade, by serial number, specific units to function as ventilators, without having to open them up -- it can all work over the air. So what's the point? What our firmware does is show that it is possible to re-program these devices in a way that doctors can use to effectively ventilate COVID patients. We have been able to confirm the functionality of the devices in instrumented patient circuits operated by experts in pulmonological measurement. And there are doctors who agree that, if they had an FDA-approved machine that could that can do what these machines are doing, then they could use them to clinically ventilate COVID patients in an ICU. We do have a path to get this firmware through FDA, and we would apply for FDA approval under the Emergency Use Authorization if the manufacturers absolutely refused to cooperate, but the safest and best path is for the manufacturers to enable this upgrade on their own. Separately from the very pressing COVID issues, Airbreak allows CPAP device owners to write their own extensions to customize their devices for their needs , similar to what the Magic Lantern firmware does for cameras. They can add features like the on-screen graphs shown above, or integrate external systems through the expansion port. Additionally, these tools allow the owners and users to gain a better understand their own therapy by gaining access to the sensors on the device.

Air flow rate and pressure were measured using Honeywell pressure chips and a National Instruments data acquisition board. Pressure was sent through a low pass filter and calibrated using a standardized, adjustable pressure column at 0, 15.0 and 30.0 cm H 2 O. Flow waveforms were acquired as a differential pressure and calibrated using standard 0.6, 1 and 3 L syringes and integrated to calculate tidal volumes using MATLAB. A tube was filled with polymeric stuffing until physiologic resistance was achieved. Resistance and compliance were calculated from the measured pressure volume loop. Resistance was measured to be around 13.4 cm H 2 O/L/s and compliance was measured to be 35.7 ml/cm H 2 O. The test set-up is pictured in figure 1.

Please see the Windows guide for more information. We are going to use the open-source OpenOCD debug interface to access the device. First, make sure this repository is cloned and located in your working directory. Make sure your programmer is attached to the PCB , then start OpenOCD. If you are using a programmer other than the ST-Link/V2, you will need to select the correct interface. sudo openocd -f interface/stlink-v2.cfg -f 'tcl/airsense.cfg' If your device is connected properly, you should see a bunch of output, ending with: Info : stm32f4x.cpu: hardware has 6 breakpoints, 4 watchpoints In another terminal, connect to the OpenOCD server: telnet localhost 4444 Once your OpenOCD console is successfully connected, you can continue to the next step. Dumping Vendor Firmware Warning This step is mandatory. Each subsequent step requires an original copy of the device firmware to be present in the working directory. With an original copy of the firmware, the device can always be restored to factory settings. If you lose the original firmware, you risk bricking your device! Type the following into your OpenOCD console: dump After several seconds, your device's main firmware should be backed-up to stm32.bin in the working directory - it should be exactly 1MB. Building Alternate Firmware In a third terminal window, patch the extracted firmware at stm32.bin with the patch-airsense script. This will unlock the vendor modes and configuration bits. ./patch-airsense stm32.bin stm32-unlocked.bin There are several features configurable via the patch-airsense script, some of which are simple binary patches and some of which require a 32-bit ARM toolchain. Set them as desired per the documentation here . The script might fail if the hashes of your extracted firmware do not match the one that it expects (currently SX567-0401 ). If you have a different version, please contact us for how to proceed. Flashing Now reflash the device with the modified firmware by going back to the OpenOCD console terminal and running: flash_new stm32-unlocked.bin This step takes around 20 seconds and the device should reboot afterwards. Testing After the device has been reflashed and rebooted, you can enter the clinician menu (hold down the Home button while pushing on the knob for three seconds), and you should be able to select from all of the vendor modes, including iVAPS and ST. These modes potentially allow the CPAP device to immediately be used according to the Mt Sinai BiPAP protocol. The flashing is a one-time operation. The programmer can be unplugged and moved to another device. Remember to keep a backup of the vendor firmware. Restoring Vendor Firmware In order for the vendor firmware to flash properly, it is necessary to write variables to the device's backup memory in a certain sequence.

In the firmware, it can be seen that a 3-character string is converted to hex (i.e., 01B in the example becomes 0x1B).","title":"Protocol Notes"},{"location":"info/serial-protocol/#firmware-notes","text":"","title":"Firmware Notes"},{"location":"info/tcl/","text":"OpenOCD Scripts Coming Soon","title":"OpenOCD Scripts"},{"location":"info/tcl/#openocd-scripts","text":"Coming Soon","title":"OpenOCD Scripts"},{"location":"info/testpoints/","text":"Useful Test Points The Airsense S10 mainboard is covered in test points.
